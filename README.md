# TwoGangsters

Two gangsters, Harry and Larry, had a rest in the countryside. They decided to spend some time shooting, so they put several beer cans (no more than 10) on a log. Harry started to shoot cans one after another from the leftmost to the right and Larry â€“ from the rightmost to the left. At some moment it happened so that they hit the same can.

Harry got indignant and claimed that Larry owed him a considerable sum of money because Larry deprived him of shooting some more cans. Larry became furious and told Harry that he owed an even more significant sum of money to Larry for the same reason. They started to argue but nobody remembered how many cans there were initially. And no one of them was going to search cans which were shot. Anyway, each of them remembered exactly how many cans he shot.

Determine how many cans were not shot by Harry and how many cans were not shot by Larry.
